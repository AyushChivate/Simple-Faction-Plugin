# Simple Factions

A plugin for Minecraft 1.16.5 that allows players to create and join factions, as well as communicate with their teammates in a faction-only chat. Players can only see the name tags of other players in their faction, and faction owners can set a spawn point where players teleport to upon death if they do not have a bed.
